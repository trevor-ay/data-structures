quiz 1 and lab 1 work
Task One (1):
Functions:

summation: Calculates the sum of integers in an array.
maximum: Finds the largest integer in the array.
Steps:

Declare two functions summation and maximum.
Inside the main function:
a. Declare an array of integers of length n.
b. Prompt the user to input the value of n.
c. Allow the user to input n integers into the array.
d. Call the summation function passing the array and display the sum.
e. Call the maximum function passing the array and display the maximum value.
Task Two (2):
Structs:

Student struct containing:
Registration number (string)
Name (string)
Age (integer)
Course (Course struct)
Grades (Grade struct)
Course struct containing:
Course code (string)
Course name (string)
Grade struct containing:
Mark (integer)
Grade (char)
Operations:

Add a student.
Edit student details.
Add marks and calculate grades (using the grading system).
Ensure grades cannot be altered after calculation.
Task Three (3):
C++ Classes:

Student class with private member variables for registration number, name, age, course, and grades, and public member functions for operations like adding a student, editing details, adding marks, and calculating grades.
Course class with private member variables for course code and course name.
Grade class with private member variables for mark and grade.
Steps:

Define classes Student, Course, and Grade.
Implement member functions for each class to perform operations described in Task Two.
Task Four (4):
ADT List Specification using UML:

Create a UML diagram representing the List Abstract Data Type (ADT).
Include operations like insert, remove, get, size, etc., along with their parameters and return types.
Define relationships between different components of the List ADT.
